        # European Accessibility Act 2025: Website Compliance for Digital News Platforms

        ## Mandatory Accessibility Standards for Websites under the EAA 2025  
        The European Accessibility Act (EAA) mandates that websites of in-scope services be accessible to people with disabilities. Although the EAA doesn’t explicitly name a specific standard, it incorporates the four core principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) – **Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust (POUR)** – as the foundation for web accessibility ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=It%20does%2C%20however%2C%20call%20out,These%20principles%20are)).
        In practice, this means digital news platforms should conform to recognized standards equivalent to **WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA** for their web content. WCAG Level AA is effectively “where the EAA wants you to be,” setting the baseline for EU compliance by 2025 ([Guide to EAA 2025 compliance: Web accessibility explained](https://coaxsoft.com/blog/guide-to-eaa-2025-compliance#:~:text=%E2%80%8DWCAG%20Level%20AA%20,WCAG%20certification%20for%20your%20website)).
        Notably, the EAA covers many types of online services (e.g. e-commerce, banking, transport, media), and **media sector websites** (including digital news sites offering online content) are among those significantly affected ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=The%20EAA%20has%20significant%20implications,technology%2C%20media%2C%20and%20transport%20services)).
        To guide compliance, the EU will publish *harmonised standards* (such as an updated EN 301 549, which is based on WCAG) – any website meeting these technical standards will be presumed to conform to the EAA’s requirements ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=New%20%27harmonised%20standards%20and%20technical,accessibility%20requirements%20under%20the%20EEA)).

        In summary, news websites serving EU users should be built and maintained to **WCAG 2.1+ AA criteria** (e.g. text alternatives for non-text content, keyboard navigability, sufficient color contrast, captions on videos, etc.), ensuring content is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust for all users ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=It%20does%2C%20however%2C%20call%20out,These%20principles%20are)) ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025  -  Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=,to%20fulfil%20the%20legal%20requirements)).
       
        ## Impact of Brexit on UK-Based News Websites Serving EU Users  
        Because the EAA is an EU directive adopted after Brexit, it will **not apply within UK law** (the UK has not transposed Directive (EU) 2019/882). UK-based digital news platforms are therefore not legally bound by the EAA within the UK. However, Brexit does **not exempt UK companies from EAA obligations when serving EU customers**. 
        The Act explicitly applies to any business (EU or non-EU) that provides covered products or services to the EU market ([European Accessibility Act (EAA) | AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=,that%20trades%20in%20the%20EU)). In other words, if a UK news website is **“active in the EU” or targets EU consumers (e.g. through EU subscriptions or services)**, it must still comply with EAA standards for those users ([European Accessibility Act (EAA) | AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=,that%20trades%20in%20the%20EU)) ([The European Accessibility Act (EAA) - what businesses need to know and do. - Business Disability Forum](https://businessdisabilityforum.org.uk/resource/the-european-accessibility-act-eaa-what-businesses-need-to-know-and-do/#:~:text=The%20EAA%20applies%20to%20all,Importantly)). Failing to do so could restrict the ability to operate in EU countries or expose the company to enforcement actions in those jurisdictions. 
        It’s important to note that the UK has its own accessibility and anti-discrimination laws which remain in force post-Brexit. The **Equality Act 2010** (and related regulations) requires service providers, including private websites, to make “reasonable adjustments” for disabled users ([Digital accessibility in the EU (and UK): Recent developments and the direction of travel](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/digital-accessibility-in-the-eu-and-uk-recent-developments-and-the-direction-of-travel#:~:text=For%20the%20UK%2C%20while%20the,disabilities%2C%20both%20online%20and%20offline)). While this UK requirement is less prescriptive than the EAA, it means UK news sites still risk legal challenges at home if their websites are unusable for people with disabilities. 
        In practice, UK news organizations should treat EAA compliance as a **de facto requirement for international reach** and as a continuation of good accessibility practice. By aligning with EAA/WCAG standards, a UK news platform not only meets EU rules but also improves compliance with general accessibility duties in the UK. 

        **Key Brexit Takeaways:** Even though Britain is not implementing the EAA domestically, **UK-based digital news sites serving EU audiences should plan for EAA compliance**. This may involve auditing and updating websites to meet WCAG 2.1+ AA standards, just as an EU publisher would. It ensures the site remains accessible and legally usable by readers in EU countries, avoiding market barriers due to Brexit. UK-only news sites (with no EU market presence) won’t be subject to the EAA itself, but should still consider accessibility a best practice under UK law.

        ## Other EAA Provisions Affecting Website Operations  
        Beyond mandating technical standards, the EAA introduces several important provisions that digital news platforms must be aware of to remain compliant:

        - **Implementation Timeline:** The EAA’s accessibility requirements kick in on **June 28, 2025**. From that date, any *new* digital content or services launched in the EU must be accessible from the start ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025 - Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=While%20all%20new%20digital%20offerings%2C,to%20the%20new%20legal%20requirements)). For *existing* websites and services that were in operation before this date, the law provides a **transitional period until June 28, 2030** to retrofit and fix accessibility issues ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025 - Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=While%20all%20new%20digital%20offerings%2C,to%20the%20new%20legal%20requirements)). This means a news site already live prior to mid-2025 has up to five extra years to achieve full compliance on legacy content, but **no later than 2030**. (Notably, the EAA allows an even longer grace period for certain pre-2025 self-service terminals, but that exception doesn’t apply to websites.) Digital news providers should use the lead time effectively: any redesigns or new sections rolling out post-2025 must meet accessibility standards immediately, and a plan should be in place to bring older articles, media, and site features up to standard well before the 2030 deadline.

        - **Accessibility Statements:** Similar to the EU’s public sector web directive, the EAA will require private service providers to **publish an accessibility statement** on their websites ([European Accessibility Act 2025 | Key Steps for Compliance](https://www.levelaccess.com/compliance-overview/european-accessibility-act-eaa/#:~:text=%2A%20Consumer)). This is a public-facing page that describes the site’s compliance status and any accessibility gaps, and guides users on how to request assistance or give feedback. For a news site, the statement should detail conformance with the required standards (e.g. WCAG 2.1 AA), list any known areas of partial non-compliance, and provide a contact method for reporting problems. Maintaining an up-to-date accessibility statement not only fulfills this EAA obligation ([European Accessibility Act 2025 | Key Steps for Compliance](https://www.levelaccess.com/compliance-overview/european-accessibility-act-eaa/#:~:text=%2A%20Consumer)) but also demonstrates transparency and commitment to inclusivity to your readership.

        - **Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance:** The EAA frames accessibility as a continuous obligation rather than a one-time project. Service providers are expected to **ensure their websites remain accessible over time**, adapting to new standards and addressing issues as they arise ([Digital accessibility in the EU (and UK): Recent developments and the direction of travel](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/digital-accessibility-in-the-eu-and-uk-recent-developments-and-the-direction-of-travel#:~:text=,compliance%20with%20applicable%20accessibility%20requirements)). In practice, a news platform should integrate accessibility into regular operations – for example, testing new website features for accessibility before release, periodically auditing content, and updating for compatibility with evolving assistive technologies. The law treats accessibility akin to product safety: if a digital service falls out of compliance, the provider must take corrective action to fix it ([Digital accessibility in the EU (and UK): Recent developments and the direction of travel](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/digital-accessibility-in-the-eu-and-uk-recent-developments-and-the-direction-of-travel#:~:text=,to%20the%20competent%20national%20authorities)) ([Digital accessibility in the EU (and UK): Recent developments and the direction of travel](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/digital-accessibility-in-the-eu-and-uk-recent-developments-and-the-direction-of-travel#:~:text=,compliance%20with%20applicable%20accessibility%20requirements)). For a fast-changing news site, this means establishing processes to monitor accessibility (through user feedback, automated scans, etc.) and promptly remedy any non-conformities in the website’s design or content delivery.

        - **Enforcement and Compliance Checks:** The EAA will be enforced at the national level by EU Member State authorities. These authorities will conduct **compliance checks and respond to complaints** about inaccessible services ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=In%20each%20Member%20State%2C%20designated,including%20through%20the%20following%20procedures)) ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=enforcement%20mechanisms,compliance%20by%20the%20relevant%20operator)). For website operators, this could include audits of your news site’s accessibility features or requiring evidence of compliance (such as documentation or conformance reports). If a news website is found non-compliant, regulators may first issue a notice requiring the issues to be fixed within a given timeframe ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025 - Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=,in%20order%20to%20avoid%20risks)). Persistent failure to comply can lead to penalties – the EAA mandates that penalties be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive,” which likely means **substantial fines or legal orders** in serious cases ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=The%20EAA%20does%20not%20set,and%20accompanied)). (For example, some national implementations specify fines that can range up to tens of thousands of euros ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025 - Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=,in%20order%20to%20avoid%20risks)).) Additionally, the law ensures that consumers and advocacy groups have the right to take complaints to court or administrative bodies if a service (like a news site) isn’t accessible ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=Member%20States%20will%20be%20responsible,compliance%20by%20the%20relevant)). **Bottom line:** digital news providers must treat accessibility lapses as compliance risks – it’s far better to address issues proactively than to face enforcement action or reputational damage from complaints.

        - **Scope of Covered Content:** The EAA’s web accessibility requirements extend to **all aspects of the service that are delivered via the website.** For a news platform, this means not only the news articles, videos, and interactive content, but also any **interactive features or support services** on the site. For example, if the site offers user account management, commenting systems, subscription purchase pages, or help center pages, those must be accessible too. The Act’s Annex includes general requirements about the “provision of services,” ensuring that user interfaces, customer support, electronic payment or identification processes, etc., are usable by people with disabilities ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=The%20general%20requirements%20include%20modalities,related%20online%20and%20mobile%20applications)). News sites should therefore review **every user-facing part of their web presence** – from navigation menus and search functions to multimedia players and forms – under the lens of accessibility. Each component (login forms, contact forms, live chat, etc.) must accommodate assistive tech and follow accessible design guidelines, just as the core content does.

        - **“Design for All” Expectation:** The spirit of the EAA is to integrate accessibility from the very beginning of product/service design. This *“built-in, not bolt-on”* approach is highly relevant for website operations. When adding new features or sections to a news site, the expectation is to include accessibility in the design criteria **from the outset**, rather than trying to patch issues later ([Digital accessibility in the EU (and UK): Recent developments and the direction of travel](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/digital-accessibility-in-the-eu-and-uk-recent-developments-and-the-direction-of-travel#:~:text=,available%20on%20the%20EU%20market)). This not only ensures compliance but often results in a more robust, user-friendly site for everyone. News organizations should adopt inclusive design practices (for example, choosing an accessible CMS or front-end framework, using semantic HTML, and involving users with disabilities in usability testing of the site) to meet this expectation.

        ## Exemptions and Special Cases for News Websites under the EAA  
        The EAA includes a few **exemptions and exceptions** to its requirements, though these are limited and come with conditions. Digital news platforms should determine if any of these apply to their situation:

        - **Microenterprise Exemption:** Small companies classified as *microenterprises* are exempt from the EAA’s accessibility obligations ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=There%20are%20a%20few%20minor,exceptions%20to%20EAA%20compliance%20rules)). A microenterprise is defined as a business with **fewer than 10 employees** and **annual turnover (or balance sheet) under €2 million** ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025 - Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=,enterprises)). In the context of news, this might apply to a very small local news blog or niche online publication run by a tiny team. Such micro publishers are **not legally required to implement the EAA accessibility features** (at least for now) ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=There%20are%20a%20few%20minor,exceptions%20to%20EAA%20compliance%20rules)). However, they are *encouraged* to do so voluntarily, and from a business perspective it may still be wise – accessibility improvements can broaden audience and are relatively low-cost at small scale. **Important:** if a news site grows beyond the microenterprise threshold (or is part of a larger organization), the exemption no longer applies. The vast majority of professional news websites (operated by medium or large media companies) will not qualify for this exemption and must comply fully.

        - **Undue Burden or Fundamental Alteration Exception:** The EAA allows an exception when making a specific aspect of a product or service accessible would impose a “disproportionate burden” on the provider or require a fundamental change in the nature of the product/service ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=For%20other%20businesses%2C%20a%20specific,and%20certain%20other%20conditions%20apply)). In simpler terms, if a news website can demonstrate that a particular accessibility requirement is **technically or financially infeasible** to implement, or that it would alter the core service in an essential way, that requirement might be waived for that feature ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=,a%20given%20product%20or%20service)). However, this is a **high bar to clear**. The burden of proof is on the company to thoroughly assess and document why compliance in that instance is not achievable ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=,a%20given%20product%20or%20service)). For example, a digital news service might argue undue burden if retrofitting accessibility for an extremely old archive system is prohibitively expensive, *but* they would need to show detailed cost analysis, the impact on the service, and why alternatives are not possible. Even then, the exemption would only apply to the specific feature in question and not the site as a whole ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=For%20other%20businesses%2C%20a%20specific,and%20certain%20other%20conditions%20apply)). Companies invoking this exception must keep written documentation of their assessment for at least five years and may have to present it to regulators on request ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=would%20,and%20certain%20other%20conditions%20apply)). They also must notify the relevant national authority that they are claiming an exemption for that aspect of the service ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=To%20rely%20on%20this%20exemption%2C,in%20the%20context%20of%20the)). In practice, news organizations should be very cautious about relying on an undue burden claim. Unless a clear case can be made, it’s safer to assume that **all parts of the news website need to meet the EAA requirements**. Partial compliance by exemption is only tolerated in extreme cases and with oversight.
        
        - **Public Sector Content Overlap:** One special case to note is if the news platform is operated by a public sector body (for example, a government-run news portal or public broadcaster’s site). Public sector websites in the EU are already subject to the **Web Accessibility Directive (2016/2102)**, which has similar requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA) and mandates an accessibility statement. The EAA does not override those rules; in fact, certain services (like local transport info websites) were excluded from EAA because they were already covered by the public sector directive ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=%2A%20websites%3B%20mobile%20device,ecommerce%20services)). For a public-sector news site, compliance with the existing public sector web accessibility regulations will largely align with EAA standards. The EAA mainly extends obligations to *private* sector services, so its impact is greatest on privately run news websites that previously had no explicit legal requirement to be accessible. In any event, **no news website (public or private)** that aims to serve EU users is wholly exempt from accessibility expectations – either the public sector rules or EAA (or both) will apply, barring the microenterprise carve-out discussed above.
        
        In summary, exemptions under the EAA are **narrow**. A small news startup might avoid the mandate initially due to size, and a specific feature might get a pass if truly impracticable to fix, but **most digital news platforms will be expected to comply fully**. Even when an exception is claimed, it’s not permanent or blanket – the goal should still be to improve accessibility wherever feasible and revisit any exempted item as technology or resources evolve.
        
        ## Common Challenges for Digital News Websites in Meeting EAA Requirements  
        Implementing accessibility across a dynamic, content-rich news platform can pose several challenges. Some of the most common difficulties that news websites encounter in trying to meet EAA/WCAG requirements include:
        
        - **Multimedia Content Accessibility:** News sites often feature a high volume of images, videos, infographics, and audio clips. Ensuring all these media elements have appropriate text alternatives is a significant task. Every photo or chart in an article needs descriptive **alt text**, and all videos (including live-streamed news segments) should have **captions or transcripts** for deaf or hard-of-hearing users ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025  -  Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=,to%20fulfil%20the%20legal%20requirements)). Providing these alternatives in a fast-paced newsroom environment can be challenging – reporters and editors must integrate writing alt descriptions and uploading captions into their workflow. Live content is especially tough: e.g. live video feeds require real-time captioning or sign-language interpretation, which require planning and resources. Nonetheless, under the EAA, **all visual or audio information must be conveyed in an accessible form** ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025  -  Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=,to%20fulfil%20the%20legal%20requirements)), so news organizations need to devise processes (and invest in tools or services) to caption videos and describe images as part of publishing. Failing to do so is one of the most frequent accessibility failures on media sites (for instance, missing alt text remains a widespread issue on websites globally). News platforms must overcome the “speed vs. completeness” dilemma by prioritizing accessibility as highly as breaking the story – e.g. publish a short article quickly but update with full captions and descriptions shortly after if necessary.
        
        - **Dynamic Content and Live Updates:** Many digital news outlets provide **live blogs, tickers, or auto-updating feeds** (for example, live election results, sports scores, or breaking news updates that push new content periodically). These dynamic updates can confuse assistive technology if not handled properly – a screen reader user might not be notified of new content, or focus might move unpredictably. Making live-updating content accessible requires careful use of ARIA live regions or polite announcements so that new information is presented to users without disrupting their reading. It’s a technical challenge to ensure that any auto-refreshing content does not disorient users or become unreachable via keyboard. Similarly, features like infinite scroll (common on news sites to continuously load more articles) need to be implemented in an accessible way (with proper region markers and the ability to navigate via headings or pagination). **Timing issues** can also arise – for example, if a site uses rotating carousels or slideshows for top stories, users must have controls to pause or manual navigate them to meet operability guidelines. Managing these interactive and time-sensitive elements in compliance with WCAG can be complex, and often requires custom development and thorough testing.
        
        - **Complex Navigation and Site Structure:** News websites tend to have dense navigation menus, numerous links, and various sections (home page, categories, tag pages, etc.). Ensuring that this **navigation structure is intuitive and operable by keyboard** is a common pain point. Frequent issues include: menus that only work on hover but not via keyboard focus, skip links (to bypass large menus) missing or not functioning, and inadequate heading structure on pages. A related challenge is **content overload on pages** – a typical news homepage might have dozens of headlines and summaries; if headings and landmarks aren’t used correctly, a screen reader user might struggle to understand the page structure or quickly jump between sections. Providing clear structure (using semantic HTML5 elements like `&lt;nav&gt;`, `&lt;main&gt;`, `&lt;aside&gt;` and proper `&lt;h1&gt;…&lt;h6&gt;` hierarchy) is critical but often requires reworking templates. Additionally, ensuring every interactive element (search bars, filters, comment buttons, etc.) is properly labeled and can be operated without a mouse can involve a lot of detailed fixes. The EAA/WCAG rules (such as **keyboard accessibility and focus management**) mean news sites must carefully review menus, dropdowns, modals, and other interactive components. Many news sites also incorporate multi-level navigation (sections, subsections) and complex footer links – these all need logical tab order and screen reader labels. Addressing these navigation and structure issues often uncovers legacy design decisions that need adjusting, which can be resource-intensive.
        
        - **Third-Party Content and Advertisements:** Digital news platforms usually rely on third-party content integrations – examples include social media embeds (tweets, Facebook videos), maps, interactive charts from data providers, and especially advertising networks. These external contents are not always under the newsroom’s direct control and may not meet accessibility standards. For instance, an embedded tweet with an image might not have alt text the website can control, or an ad banner could have poor contrast or trap keyboard focus. **Advertising scripts** in particular are a tricky area: ad iframes might not announce themselves well to screen readers, and auto-playing ad videos could violate accessibility if they cannot be paused or muted easily. News sites face the challenge of balancing revenue and accessibility – they may need to work with ad partners that provide accessible ads, or at least ensure the site’s own code does not compound the issue (for example, by clearly delineating ad sections with labels like “Advertisement” that screen readers can identify). Similarly, if the site includes commenting platforms or interactive tools from third parties, those need evaluation – an inaccessible comment plugin could undermine overall compliance. The challenge is that fixing third-party content may involve lobbying the provider or finding alternative solutions if the provider cannot accommodate needs. Under the EAA, the **news site is still responsible for the overall user experience**, so it must mitigate third-party shortcomings (perhaps by offering text alternatives or warning users) or choose providers that align with accessibility requirements.
        
        - **Legacy Content and Archives:** Established news websites often have **archives spanning many years**, with tens of thousands of pages of content. Older articles may have been published before accessibility was a priority – images might lack alt text, older videos might have no transcripts, PDF downloads (like report attachments) might be untagged/unreadable, etc. Bringing an entire archive up to compliance is a daunting task. The EAA’s transitional period until 2030 for existing content provides some breathing room ([Everything you need to know about the new European Accessibility Act 2025  -  Quivo](https://quivo.co/us/european-accessibility-act-2025/#:~:text=While%20all%20new%20digital%20offerings%2C,to%20the%20new%20legal%20requirements)), but the effort required is still significant. Common challenges include: locating and updating old media files with captions/alt text, possibly needing to regenerate transcripts for audio content, and converting or replacing inaccessible document formats. News sites might need to prioritize which archive sections to fix first (perhaps the most visited articles or key topic pages) due to the sheer volume. Additionally, the content management systems (CMS) used in earlier eras might not support modern accessibility without redevelopment. There is also the editorial question of whether to temporarily withdraw certain non-compliant old content (e.g., very interactive special features from a decade ago that no longer work accessibly) until they can be remediated. All of this requires project management focus: creating an **accessibility remediation backlog** and steadily working through it in the years leading up to 2030. Resource constraints (time, budget, staff) make this a long-term challenge for news organizations, especially those with rich archives.
        
        - **Rapid Publishing Cycle and Staff Training:** Newsrooms operate on tight deadlines, pushing content out quickly. This fast pace can conflict with the meticulous nature of accessibility work. A common challenge is ensuring **journalists, editors, and web producers are trained** to create accessible content on the fly. For example, reporters must know to write meaningful link text (not just “click here”), add captions to images in the CMS, and avoid uploading infographics without accompanying descriptions. Editors need to enforce style guidelines that favor accessibility (like simpler language, proper heading usage, no reliance on color alone to convey meaning in charts, etc.). Under time pressure, there’s a risk of these practices being skipped. Overcoming this requires consistent training and a culture that values accessibility as part of quality journalism – not an afterthought. Some news sites implement checklists or CMS validations (e.g., preventing an article from publishing if required accessibility fields are empty) to mitigate human error. Another challenge is keeping staff updated on new requirements; as WCAG updates (2.2, 3.0 in future) or as national EAA implementations evolve, teams must adapt. High turnover in media means new hires might not be aware of accessibility standards. All told, **building accessibility awareness into the newsroom workflow** is an ongoing effort. It can be challenging to secure the needed training budget and time in a busy newsroom, but without it, meeting EAA compliance consistently will be difficult.
        
        Each of these challenges can be overcome with planning, the right tools, and organizational commitment. Awareness of these common pitfalls is the first step; from there, news websites can allocate resources (human and technical) to address them one by one. The next section provides guidance on how to tackle compliance in a practical, efficient manner.
        
        ## Guidance and Actionable Steps for EAA Compliance  
        Digital news platforms should take a proactive approach to meet the EAA’s 2025 requirements. Below is a set of clear, actionable steps and best practices to guide news websites toward compliance, while also improving overall user experience:
        
        1. **Audit Your Current Website:** Begin with a thorough **accessibility audit** of the news site’s pages and features. Use a combination of automated testing tools and manual expert reviews to identify where your site falls short of WCAG 2.1 AA criteria. Many issues (like missing alt text, form label errors, or low contrast text) can be initially detected by scanners – for instance, the WebAIM 1 Million analysis found an average of 56 accessibility errors per page on popular sites ([The Most Common Web Accessibility Issue of 2024 (and How to Fix It)](https://www.boia.org/blog/the-most-common-web-accessibility-issue-of-2024-and-how-to-fix-it#:~:text=%2A%2095.9,every%2021%20home%20page%20elements)), with low-contrast text being the most common issue (found on 81% of homepages) ([The Most Common Web Accessibility Issue of 2024 (and How to Fix It)](https://www.boia.org/blog/the-most-common-web-accessibility-issue-of-2024-and-how-to-fix-it#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20most%20web%20designers%20ignore,of%20homepages)). These kinds of known issues should be checked on your site. Automated tools (e.g. WAVE, Axe, or Lighthouse) are a good start and can quickly flag obvious problems ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=on%20a%20variety%20of%20accessibility,all%20skill%20and%20experience%20levels)). However, remember they only catch ~30% of issues; manual testing (navigating the site with keyboard only, running a screen reader through key workflows, etc.) is essential to find things like improper focus order or missing contextual cues. **Document all identified issues** and categorize them (e.g. by severity or by template). This audit forms the baseline for your compliance plan.
        
        2. **Develop a Remediation Roadmap:** With the audit results, create a prioritized list of fixes. Tackle **critical barriers first** – issues that impede basic access to content, such as lack of keyboard access to menus or images with vital information lacking descriptions. Align your roadmap with the EAA timeline: ensure that any *new* site features will launch accessible by 2025, and schedule the backlog of existing issues to be resolved well before 2030. For each issue or category of issues, assign responsibility (development team for code fixes, editorial team for content fixes, etc.) and set target dates. It may help to break the work into phases: e.g., Phase 1 could ensure all new articles have alt text and all videos from this point forward have captions; Phase 2 could retrofit captions to archival videos from the past year; Phase 3 might involve a full template redesign for navigation and forms, and so on. **Consider the quick wins** (like adjusting CSS for color contrast ([The Most Common Web Accessibility Issue of 2024 (and How to Fix It)](https://www.boia.org/blog/the-most-common-web-accessibility-issue-of-2024-and-how-to-fix-it#:~:text=Low,WCAG%20establishes%20simple%20design%20thresholds)), or adding alt text via CMS bulk edit) versus longer-term projects (like overhauling a video player). The roadmap should also account for third-party components – reach out early to vendors for solutions or replacements if needed. Importantly, get management buy-in for the remediation plan, as it may require dedicated time from already-busy teams.
        
        3. **Integrate Accessibility into Daily Workflow:** Compliance isn’t a one-time project – it requires ongoing effort. News organizations should incorporate accessibility checks into their **content publishing and development processes**. For example:  
           - Establish editorial guidelines for accessibility (covering things like writing descriptive link text, including text transcripts for audio, writing in plain language, etc.) and train all content creators on them.  
           - Update the CMS workflows: make fields like *alternative text* for images mandatory, and provide editorial staff with training or tools to write good alt descriptions. If your CMS has an accessibility plugin or can be extended to flag issues (e.g., warning if the text is too long without headings), enable those features.  
           - For developers, adopt an **accessibility-first development approach**. When designing new site features or layouts, use semantic HTML and ARIA roles appropriately from the start. Add unit tests or integration tests for accessibility (for instance, tests to ensure that keyboard focus moves as expected when modals open, or that form inputs have labels). Leverage linters or CI pipeline checks that fail a build if accessibility regressions are introduced.  
           - Incorporate assistive technology in QA: e.g., include a step in your release checklist to test new pages with a screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver) and with only keyboard input. This catches many issues before they go live.  
           - Set up a monitoring routine: run automated scans on key pages regularly (weekly or with each deployment) to catch any newly introduced errors. Some services can monitor and alert you if, say, a new image was added without alt text or if a third-party script injected an inaccessible element.  
        Embedding accessibility into daily operations ensures that once you fix issues, you **stay compliant over time** – which is exactly what the EAA expects ([Digital accessibility in the EU (and UK): Recent developments and the direction of travel](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/digital-accessibility-in-the-eu-and-uk-recent-developments-and-the-direction-of-travel#:~:text=,compliance%20with%20applicable%20accessibility%20requirements)). It also prevents a buildup of new issues that would require another big fix effort later.
        
        4. **Provide an Accessibility Statement & Feedback Channel:** As required, publish a clear **Accessibility Statement** on the site ([European Accessibility Act 2025 | Key Steps for Compliance](https://www.levelaccess.com/compliance-overview/european-accessibility-act-eaa/#:~:text=%2A%20Consumer)). This page should outline the standards you aim to meet (e.g., “This website follows WCAG 2.1 AA and EN 301 549 requirements”), the current compliance status (mention any significant gaps if applicable), and importantly, a way for users to contact you with accessibility issues or requests. Make the link to this statement easily findable (usually in the footer). Equally crucial is setting up an internal process to handle feedback received through this channel. Assign a team or person to monitor accessibility emails/requests and respond in a timely manner. User feedback can be an invaluable supplement to your testing – real users may report barriers that were missed. Under the EAA, consumers and organizations have the right to raise complaints ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=Member%20States%20will%20be%20responsible,compliance%20by%20the%20relevant)), so handling issues directly can prevent escalation. Your statement can also list any **known workarounds or alternatives** (for instance, “if you cannot access our interactive map, we provide a text-based live update as an alternative”). Being transparent and responsive not only helps with compliance but builds trust with your audience.
        
        5. **Train and Sensitize Your Team:** Ensure that everyone involved in producing and maintaining the news site – from journalists and editors to web developers, designers, and product managers – understands the basics of web accessibility and their responsibilities in upholding it. Conduct training sessions on EAA and WCAG principles so that staff can **identify and avoid common pitfalls** (like those mentioned in the challenges above). For example, journalists should practice writing in clear language and designers should learn color contrast rules. Some organizations run empathy labs or use simulators so staff can experience how a blind user or a keyboard-only user navigates the site. This can be eye-opening and motivate adherence to guidelines. Keeping the team updated on accessibility is an ongoing process (accessibility should be part of onboarding for new hires, and periodic refreshers should be given, especially if guidelines update or if the site undergoes a major redesign). Remember that accessibility is a cross-functional effort – it’s not solely the developer’s job or the compliance officer’s job. **Instill a culture** where accessibility is considered a core aspect of quality content and good user experience. This cultural shift will make compliance tasks much smoother and sustainable in the long run.
        
        6. **Leverage Tools, Frameworks, and Experts:** Don’t hesitate to use available **resources and expertise** to meet EAA requirements. There are many free guidelines and checklists (the W3C’s “Understanding WCAG” documents, for instance, provide detailed how-tos ([Prepare Your Website for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) - Lumar](https://www.lumar.io/blog/a11y-industry-news/how-to-prepare-your-website-for-upcoming-european-accessibility-act-eaa-compliance/#:~:text=2,and%20the%20%E2%80%9CUnderstanding%20WCAG%E2%80%9D%20documents))) and community-driven tutorials for making specific types of content accessible. Consider using accessibility overlays or widgets cautiously – while they can provide some immediate improvements (like enabling text resizing or color contrast toggles), they are not a substitute for proper coding and can sometimes introduce issues of their own. It’s often more effective to fix the root issues in your site’s code. If your team lacks accessibility specialists, it might be worthwhile to **engage consultants** or services familiar with news media platforms. An expert audit or even user testing with people with disabilities can reveal issues specific to your site’s design. Additionally, some modern web frameworks have accessibility baked in or have add-ons (for example, certain front-end libraries ensure modals and dialogs meet ARIA best practices, etc.). Use these to your advantage instead of reinventing the wheel. The EAA compliance deadline is firm, so if internal capacity is limited, outsourcing some remediation tasks or using professional training for your staff can accelerate progress. Ultimately, compliance is achievable, and numerous tools (automated scanners, browser plugins, code libraries) and experts are out there to help you get there efficiently.
        
        7. **Plan for Maintenance and Future Updates:** Achieving compliance by 2025 (or 2030 for legacy fixes) is not the end – plan for how the site will **stay accessible going forward**. Set up a schedule for periodic re-evaluation (for instance, a quarterly accessibility review of random pages, or re-auditing whenever there’s a major site update). Track metrics: you could monitor the number of accessibility issues open vs. resolved, or use analytics to see if more users with assistive tech are engaging successfully (some analytics can show usage of accessibility features). Keep an eye on evolving standards – WCAG will continue to evolve (2.2, 2.3, and eventually WCAG 3.0). The EAA’s harmonized standards will also be updated; staying current with these will future-proof your compliance. Also, be prepared for new content formats – for example, if your newsroom starts using 360-degree videos or AR/VR presentations in the future, ensure you consider accessibility for those new media from the start. Having an **accessibility champion or task force** internally can help maintain focus. This group can regularly report on the site’s accessibility status to leadership, ensuring it remains a priority after the initial compliance rush. In essence, treat accessibility as an ongoing quality attribute of your news service, just like security or performance, requiring continuous attention.
        
        8. **Understand Exceptions but Strive for Full Compliance:** If you believe your site might qualify for an exemption (like the microenterprise status or an undue burden for a specific feature), make sure to **conclusively verify and document that**. It’s wise to consult legal counsel or accessibility experts in such cases to ensure you meet the criteria and follow the required procedures (e.g. documenting an undue burden analysis) ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=would%20,and%20certain%20other%20conditions%20apply)). However, even if exempt, remember that accessibility is beneficial for your audience at large. Micro news sites, for example, may not be *forced* to comply by law, but making your content accessible can increase reach and user satisfaction. Use the exemption period (or additional time) to incrementally improve accessibility rather than ignore it completely. For larger outlets, avoid leaning on “disproportionate burden” unless absolutely necessary – regulators will expect to see that you tried all reasonable alternatives first. Generally, aim for **full compliance across your digital offerings**, so you don’t have to worry about whether an exception applies or risk parts of your site being unusable by segments of the public. Exceeding the minimum (going toward WCAG AAA in some areas) can even be a differentiator and prepare you for future stricter standards. 
        
        By following these steps, digital news platforms can navigate the EAA’s requirements effectively. Compliance should be viewed not just as a legal duty, but as an opportunity: improving accessibility will enhance the usability of the news site for everyone, encourage a wider audience (including the 100+ million Europeans with disabilities or age-related impairments ([European Accessibility Act: is it time to update your websites, products & services to meet Europe’s accessibility requirements? - Bird & Bird](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2024/global/european-accessibility-act#:~:text=The%20EAA%20defines%20persons%20with,also%20covered%20by%20the%20EAA))), and demonstrate the publisher’s commitment to inclusive journalism. Starting now – ahead of the 2025 deadline – will spread out the effort and ensure your website meets the European Accessibility Act with time to spare, putting you on the right side of both the law and your readers’ needs.
