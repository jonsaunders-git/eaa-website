            <h2>Enforcement & Compliance Checks</h2>
            <div class="modal-text">
                <p>The EAA will be enforced at the national level by designated authorities in each EU Member State. These authorities will conduct <strong>compliance checks and respond to complaints</strong> about inaccessible services.</p>
                
                <p>For news website operators, this could include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Formal audits of your site's accessibility features</li>
                    <li>Requests for evidence of compliance (such as documentation or conformance reports)</li>
                    <li>Investigation of user complaints submitted through official channels</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>If a news website is found non-compliant, regulators may first issue a notice requiring the issues to be fixed within a given timeframe. Persistent failure to comply can lead to penalties – the EAA mandates that penalties be "effective, proportionate and dissuasive," which likely means <strong>substantial fines or legal orders</strong> in serious cases.</p>
                
                <p>Some national implementations specify fines that can range up to tens of thousands of euros. Additionally, the law ensures that consumers and advocacy groups have the right to take complaints to court or administrative bodies if a service isn't accessible.</p>
                
                <p>Businesses should prepare for these compliance checks by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintaining thorough documentation of accessibility efforts</li>
                    <li>Creating and regularly updating an accessibility statement</li>
                    <li>Establishing internal processes to address reported issues quickly</li>
                    <li>Conducting regular self-audits to identify and fix problems proactively</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The bottom line: digital news providers must treat accessibility lapses as compliance risks – it's far better to address issues proactively than to face enforcement action or reputational damage from complaints.</p>

            <h2>Potential Penalties</h2>
            <div class="modal-text">
                <p>The EAA requires that all penalties for non-compliance be <strong>"effective, proportionate and dissuasive"</strong>. While the exact penalties will vary by EU member state, businesses can expect serious consequences including:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Financial penalties:</strong> Fines that could range from several thousand to tens of thousands of euros, depending on the severity of non-compliance, size of the organization, and impact on users</li>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory remediation orders:</strong> Legal requirements to fix accessibility issues within specific timeframes</li>
                    <li><strong>Market restrictions:</strong> Potential limitations on selling products or services within EU markets until compliance is achieved</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal proceedings:</strong> Exposure to lawsuits from individual consumers or advocacy groups under national legal frameworks</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For digital news platforms, non-compliance could result in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Orders to redesign key website features or functionality</li>
                    <li>Requirements to provide alternative accessible versions of content</li>
                    <li>Mandatory reporting to regulatory authorities on remediation progress</li>
                    <li>Public disclosure of non-compliance findings, resulting in reputational damage</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Importantly, the EAA creates a legal framework for consumers and organizations representing people with disabilities to take action through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Administrative procedures with national enforcement bodies</li>
                    <li>Court proceedings in cases of persistent non-compliance</li>
                    <li>Consumer protection mechanisms</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>News organizations should note that enforcement will likely become more stringent over time as accessibility awareness increases and national authorities develop their enforcement mechanisms.</p>

            <div class="modal-text">
                <p>To prevent legal consequences and ensure compliance with the EAA, digital news providers should adopt a proactive and comprehensive approach to accessibility. Key steps include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conducting regular accessibility audits:</strong> Use automated testing tools and manual reviews to identify accessibility issues on your website and digital content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintaining comprehensive compliance documentation:</strong> Keep records of all accessibility efforts, including audit results, remediation plans, and user feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Establishing internal processes to address reported issues quickly:</strong> Create a system for users to report accessibility issues and ensure that these issues are addressed promptly and effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creating and regularly updating an accessibility statement:</strong> Publish a clear and detailed accessibility statement on your website, outlining your commitment to accessibility and providing contact information for users to report issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Providing accessibility training for staff:</strong> Ensure that all staff members involved in creating and maintaining digital content receive training on accessibility best practices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engaging with users with disabilities:</strong> Seek feedback from users with disabilities to identify and address accessibility issues and improve the overall user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staying up-to-date with accessibility standards and guidelines:</strong> Keep abreast of the latest accessibility standards and guidelines, such as WCAG, and ensure that your website and digital content comply with these standards.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>By taking these steps, digital news providers can significantly reduce their legal risks and ensure that their content is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.</p>
