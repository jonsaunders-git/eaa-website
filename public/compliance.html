            <h2>Conduct an Accessibility Audit</h2>
            <div class="modal-text">
                <p>Evaluate your website against WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA standards. Use automated tools like <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WAVE</a> and manual testing with screen readers.</p>
                <p>Automated tools can help identify common issues such as missing alt text, contrast errors, and improper use of ARIA attributes. However, manual testing is essential to catch issues that automated tools might miss, such as keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.</p>
                <p>Regular audits ensure that your website remains compliant as new content is added and as accessibility standards evolve.</p>
                <p>In practice, this means digital news platforms should conform to recognized standards equivalent to WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA for their web content. WCAG Level AA is effectively “where the EAA wants you to be,” setting the baseline for EU compliance by 2025.</p>
                <p>To guide compliance, the EU will publish harmonised standards (such as an updated EN 301 549, which is based on WCAG) – any website meeting these technical standards will be presumed to conform to the EAA’s requirements.</p>
                <p>In summary, news websites serving EU users should be built and maintained to WCAG 2.1+ AA criteria (e.g. text alternatives for non-text content, keyboard navigability, sufficient color contrast, captions on videos, etc.), ensuring content is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust for all users.</p>

            <h2>Implement Required Fixes</h2>
            <div class="modal-text">
                <p>Fix non-compliant elements such as contrast issues, missing alternative text, keyboard navigability, and incorrect ARIA attributes.</p>
                <p>Ensure that all images have descriptive alt text, all interactive elements are keyboard accessible, and that ARIA attributes are used correctly to enhance accessibility for screen reader users.</p>
                <p>Addressing these issues promptly helps prevent accessibility barriers for users with disabilities and ensures compliance with the EAA.</p>
                <p>Here are some specific steps to implement required fixes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast Issues:</strong> Ensure that text and background colors have sufficient contrast to be readable by users with visual impairments. Use tools like the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a> to verify contrast ratios.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternative Text:</strong> Provide descriptive alt text for all images, ensuring that screen reader users can understand the content and purpose of each image.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard Navigability:</strong> Ensure that all interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons, forms) are accessible via keyboard. Users should be able to navigate through the website using the Tab key and activate elements using the Enter or Space keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>ARIA Attributes:</strong> Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes correctly to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and interactive elements. Ensure that ARIA roles, states, and properties are used appropriately to convey information to screen readers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By addressing these issues, you can create a more inclusive and accessible website that complies with the EAA and provides a better user experience for all visitors.</p>

                <p>An accessibility statement demonstrates your commitment to accessibility and provides transparency about your efforts. It should include contact information for users to report issues and a summary of the steps you have taken to ensure accessibility.</p>
                <p>Regularly updating the statement ensures that it reflects the current state of your website's accessibility and any ongoing efforts to improve it.</p>
